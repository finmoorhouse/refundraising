      <h1>REFUNDRAISING</h1>
      <p>
      The COVID-19 outbreak has quickly become a global crisis. Around the world, events and trips have been cancelledâ€“ from music festivals to plane tickets to sporting events. Refunds are being offered by the millions.</p><p>

In this uncertain time, we all want to do our part: to tackle the pandemic together with local relief efforts, help those most in need around the world, and see that humanity is better prepared in the future.
</p>
<p>
The REFUNDRAISING idea is simple: we want event organisers to pledge to include an option to give back some of your coronavirus-refunds to causes on the frontline of research, response, and prevention. And you can encourage them to do so on social media.
