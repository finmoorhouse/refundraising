      <h1>Pledge to Refundraise</h1>
      <h2>Event Organisers</h2>
      <p>Event organisers: we want you to get on board! We're asking you to implement an option in your refund process to give a part of the refund to the relief fund. By joining now, you have the opportunity to be a forerunner, and set an example for other events, platforms and organisers.</p>
      <h2>Individuals</h2>
      <p>
      You can encourage event organisers to include an option to donate to the COVID-19 relief fund by emailing or calling the organisers or events near to you. Send them to this website (<a href='https://refundraising.org/' target='_blank'>refundraising.org</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
      If you are expecting or have received a refund caused by the coronavirus outbreak, you can also directly donate to our COVID-19 fund. We recommend either £20 or 20% of your refund – whatever seems reasonable to you (although you’re free to choose any amount). And check out <a href='https://cancelcorona.org/' target='_blank'>cancelcorona.org</a>!
